This is supposed to be of "old tech" plain C objects without any
bindings fancy dependencies.  They mostly serve as API simplifications
for, well, things I need in other projects.

License is GPL, but I don't care much about what it is.  Some need to
be GPL due to multiple contributors, but if the code is by me and you
want it, but GPL doesn't work for you, drop me a line and I'll release
it under something more compatible.

Unmarked code is (c) 2003-2013 Tom Schouten <tom@zwizwa.be>
Other authors are mentioned in the specific files.


Some of these objects are from libprim and have stubbed-out code for
the LEAF base object library.
