The core components (leaf, PF, SC) are licensed under the terms of the
GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL).  See the file COPYING for
details.

Note that the use of some optional components requires a re-licencing
under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).  Most notably
the GSL and some of the FFMPEG code.

Documentation will follow in the near future.  The dev log is
published online at:  http://zwizwa.be/-/libprim

Current focus is on stabilizing the project's Scheme and PF
interpreters, which are intended to be embedded in an application as a
static library.

Building
--------

./configure && make && make install

See ./configure --help for options.  Without the install step the
interpreters can be run in their own directory: see sc/sc and pf/pf.


Dependencies
------------

The usual (GNU make + GCC) plus

`mzscheme' for bootstrap code generation
http://plt-scheme.org

`leg' for the s-expression parser 
http://piumarta.com/software/peg/

`ffmpeg' for the media library.  Last tested: svn rev 20455 (2009/11/5).
