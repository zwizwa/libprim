libprim (c) 2003-2015 Tom Schouten

An application core library for multimedia applications.

This is a collection of simple objects that can be manipulated from C
using manual garbage collection (create + free).  On top of this code
two scripting languages are implemented: Packet Forth (PF) and an
(almost) R4RS compliant standard Scheme.


License
-------

See the file COPYING which describes the licensing terms of all code
files in this project unless otherwise noted at the top of the file.

Caveat: outside of the core, there are optional parts released under
GNU General Public Licence (GPL), or wrappers around GPL library code.



Documentation
-------------

Given an understanding of the basic architecture, the project should
be self-documenting.  Proper documentation will follow in the near
future.  The dev log is published online at: http://zwizwa.be/-/libprim


Building
--------

./configure && make && make install

See ./configure --help for options.  Without the install step the
interpreters can be run in their own directory: see sc/sc and pf/pf.


Dependencies
------------

The usual (GNU make + GCC) plus

`mzscheme' for bootstrap code generation
http://plt-scheme.org

`leg' for the s-expression parser 
http://piumarta.com/software/peg/

`ffmpeg' for the media library.  Last tested: svn rev 20455 (2009/11/5).

on Debian: apt-get install build-essential libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev


History
-------

The current incarnation of this project started in August 2009, as a
restructuring of Packet Forth, which itself is a fork of PDP for Pure
Data, a project started in 2003.
