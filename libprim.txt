A ``primitive oriented'' scripting language core.

Is it possible to write a C application with an ``invisible''
scripting language?  I.e. use a (dynamically typed) language during
prototype development and debugging, but ``optimize it out''
completely in the deployed application?

This project should be understood in a background of embedded control
programming problems.

I've been using the C + scripting approach for a while, and the
conclusion I make is that I spend too much time on the ``impedance
match'' between the C side and the scripting language.  Is it possible
to find a way to write C primitives such that it is easily
(automatically) incorporated in the scripting side?

If the answer is yes (and I think it is), then it is probably best to
build the _whole_ scripting language on such C primitives.

This project is roughly based on the following ideas:

   * C primitives can take the semantics of _lightweight tasks_.
     Along side other benefits of concurrency-oriented programming,
     the property of interest is the ability to decouple the C side
     from the scripting language's _memory_ and _control_ models.

   * Concurrency-oriented programming allows intermediate composite
     data types to be replaced with serial channels and protocols.
     (``Pre-emptive Deforestation'').

   * Linear memory model: C primitives use only atoms which are either
     C primitives (integers and floats), or abstract objects whos
     ownership is clearly indicated.

This would allow to build a library of primitive operations and
datatypes that can be linked with any kind of scripting language
during prototyping or debugging.

The idea is that by isolating the primitives from the memory and
control models of the debugging code, in a final application all
``scripting glue'' can be optimized away and replaced with a minimal
scheduler and memory manager, possibly both static.



Entry: A bit less cryptic
Date: Tue Aug  4 11:14:36 CEST 2009

From a practical day-to-day problem solving pov, C is not going
anywhere because next to a programming language, it is also an
interface standard.  Anything that tries to incorporate modern
language techniques in an embedded programming project needs to play
nice with C.

So, instead of focussing on building new languages, I think it is
worthwhile to do some semantics engineering on subsets of C itself, by
providing an infrastructure that makes it easier to bootstrap
``functional, concurrency oriented C code''.

Hopefully this idea will become easier to articulate once the
implementation is done.

The goal is this:

   * Write a re-usable collection of C primitives necessary to support
     a dynamically typed scripting language, but do this in such a way
     that it does _not_ depend on external memory or control models.

   * To test the primitives and the programming method, write a couple
     of dyntyped scripting languages (memory and control models) on
     top of the primitives.  I'm thinking about two: a PF-like
     concatenative linear stack language and a Scheme-like
     CONS/CONT/GC based language.

   * Write a compiler for static memory allocation and scheduling to
     optimize away the scripting layer.

Later this could be extended with an ML-style statically typed
language.  Given that the goal of the project is _prototyping_ which
is mainly _evolving specification_ I think it's better to stick to a
simpler dynamically typed approach.


Entry: CEKS machine
Date: Tue Aug  4 11:25:38 CEST 2009

Scheme implemented in terms of a CEKS[1] machine.  Focus on the
evaluator first and ignore GC.  Some CEKS machine for
Javascript[3][4].

It might be easier to start with the CEK machine, and add the store
and GC later.

Anyways..  I started with the GC.  Bottom up seems better.  It already
gives a way to encode types.

Entry: Primitives and Composition, an OS?
Date: Tue Aug  4 12:25:20 CEST 2009

Any form of language design is based on building primitives (axioms)
and composition mechanism (inference rules).

Is is a stretch to say that an Operating System is actually a
composition mechanism?  If tasks are primitives, gluing tasks together
is what the OS does.


Entry: Aspect oriented programming
Date: Tue Aug  4 12:29:47 CEST 2009

The idea I'm trying to encode is the addition of join points to a C
program: make all these points available to an observer (scripting
language).

Entry: Garbage Collector
Date: Tue Aug  4 14:53:52 CEST 2009

I've added a simple copying GC in ceks/gc.c for allocating vectors, as
a memory model for implementing the Scheme interpreter.  It uses
tagged objects: vectors, atoms, integers, and one available user tag.

The vectors themselves can be tagged (i.e. to implement a couple of
primitive structs) when the maximum vector size size is limited.

Instead of using a hash table, a preliminary implementation could just
use a stack.  This will make parsing slower, but can be easily changed
later.


Entry: Continuations
Date: Tue Aug  4 20:32:34 CEST 2009

So.. ISWIM uses n-ary primitive application, but unary abstraction and
application.  Why is this?  It seems that it makes the extension of
the environment on application easier: only a single variable has to
be added.

Maybe this isn't necessary for Scheme.  A multivalued application adds
all variables at the same time.  Instead of arg,fun,opd as explained
in PLLC, I needs just a single type that evaluates all variables in an
application from left to right, starting with the function position,
and then performs either an application (extending the environment) or
a primitive evaluation (production of a value).

So how to represent (x x x _ x x x) where "_" is the hole?

In short: what does the CEKS machine do?

   It converts the current expression and its continuation in a
   simplified expression and an updated continuation.  It is
   _application_ (triggered by the availability of the last argument)
   that _pops_ the K stack.

So.. Representing continuations.

(((f a b) E) K) -> ( _ (((f E) (a E) (b E)) K))
                -> ((f E) (((a E) (b E)) K))



Entry: Objects and Lambdas
Date: Wed Aug  5 09:43:14 CEST 2009

What I'm trying to accomplish probably has a lot of parallells with
COLA[1].  However, my concern is mostly interoperability with C.

Anyways.  GC and objects.  It might be wise to require objects to
exhibit a class structure: each object points to a record of methods,
where the first couple are used by the GC.

Entry: Confused about primitives
Date: Wed Aug  5 13:14:07 CEST 2009

This is ironic: the goal is to properly define primitives, but I'm
already getting hosed!

Once conclusion to draw: there is a set of C primitives that is best
written directly in the required API (sc ,object, ...) -> object
instead of in unwrapped C, because of the tight coupling with the data
representation.  These _direct primitives_ are written manually.

In short: to keep things simple, the interpreter is written in terms
of primitive functions using all scheme datatypes (ala tinyscheme).

What cannot be avoided however is functions that convert between
scheme and C values (esp. strings<-> and ints).  it's best to limit
the use however, and try to use as much as possible real scheme
primitives to avoid duplication (don't give in to premature opti
here!).

So, let's try it:

          All C functions used in the implementation of the Scheme
          interpreter are Scheme primitives.

This fixes the primitive calling convention to:

object fn(sc*, object, ...)

This will raise other problems since I'm not sure it's possible to
have variable argument invokation (assumed from Pure Data source).


Entry: Representing constants
Date: Wed Aug  5 13:54:45 CEST 2009

I might be useful to make it possible to directly cast non-managed
objects, by assuming the class pointer is in the slot _before_ the
pointer.  It is upto the user then to _never_ place them inside GC
managed vectors, as they won't have a valid class pointer.

Elaborate on this a bit..

I.e. it would be nice for a (const char *) to be a valid object that
can reside in a collected data structure.  I.e. the object itself
should be recognizable as not requiring free().

The problem then is that I'm running out of tags:

00 non-managed pointer
01 vector
10 integer
11 bool

Using more than 2 tag bits places extra contstraints on pointer
alignment.  Booleans are useful for predicate implementation in
Scheme.

It is possible however to use the 01 vector slot, since we know what
that will point to:
     - integer (it's a live vector, and the int = size)
     - vector  (moved object)

This could be a non-managed pointer to represent a class?

Maybe another workaround is simpler: doubly wrapping all predicates
and representing bools as integers.

Let's stick to what we have and thing about this a bit more.. It looks
like bools are more useful than constants.  

Otoh: since bools require only two values, and are actually constants,
the problem is solved:


00 constant = non-managed pointer
01 vector
10 integer
11 managed pointer


Let's implement this first before rewriting everything to primitives.


Entry: Unsafe pointers
Date: Wed Aug  5 15:49:26 CEST 2009

I get it now: by making sure the atom_class pointer is the slot one
_before_ the atom pointer, it is possible to write unsafe functions
without too much hassle.

The free() pointer is stored in a class object.  This class object is
the value's type.  Some values however are only statically typed, and
appear as unsafe pointers if they make it into Scheme land.



Entry: debugging
Date: Wed Aug  5 17:48:59 CEST 2009

Hmm.. it's more difficult than I thought.  The interpreter itself I
can probably get debugged, since its structure is quite
straightforward.  However, the GC is going to be an adventure.
Currently I have no way to properly mark roots in case GC is
triggered inside a C primitive.

During the evaluation of step() we could push all allocated atoms to a
stack, and discard it at the end.  This makes sure that intermediate
data will not be freed.

Alternatively, the heap could be marked such that all objects past the
marker need to be copied first.

But this then wouldn't work if there are 2 or more collections.

Alternatively, the marking point could be translated into a vector
that is then added to a local stack of references.

The real question is: does the interpreter know what to mark?

Let's change a gc->root into a callback function.

Done.

Now it shouldn't be to hard to turn a gc marker into an array.
Basicly something like this:

        sc->marker = gc_marker(sc->gc)
        step()
        free_retain_stack()

If there is a collection we do something like

        push_retain_stack(gc_marker_to_vector(sc->marker))
        mark_all()
        sc->marker = gc_marker(sc->gc)


OR

do it manually.
which is probably too error-prone..

Ok.. what about keeping most of it hidden inside the GC.

When the GC calls mark_roots() it will pass in a vector of references
containing the objects that were saved since the last border mark.

Actually, this fancy trick doesn't work because the C stack still has
the _old_ pointers.

Not simple!

One option would be to abort the primitive whenever a collection is
necessary.  If they are written in a purely functional style this
shouldn't be a problem.


Entry: mixing GC and C
Date: Wed Aug  5 19:44:17 CEST 2009

The problem is this: a gc_alloc() inside a primitive might trigger a
collection.  At that point, all the pointers on the C stack will
become invalid.

To overcome this, all primitives that trigger gc_alloc() should be
purely functional, such that an allocation can restart the interpreter
step() that triggered the gc_alloc().

So.. If the gc itself is also made stateless (and written in CPS) then
this could work pretty well.

Lets see if gc_alloc() can be aborted.

Looks like it.. One problem however is that the current implementation
of gc_grow() will never be reached, so the program will end up in an
infinite loop when there isn't enough memory to account for a single
primitive execution.  Here the mark_wild() function would come in
handy:

If it is detected that a single primitive step cannot continue because
there is not enough heap space, the heap needs to grow.  As long as
gc_collect() doesn't abort the current GC invocation, this can be done
automatically.


Entry: constant strings
Date: Wed Aug  5 21:29:40 CEST 2009

Since these are not aligned, they cannot be objects.  So, no
constant strings.

Some goes for primitives.

So primitive execution seems to work.  Still to test: abstraction and

So, let's install the preemption based garbage collector + write the

Entry: constants vs. closures
Date: Thu Aug  6 12:09:08 CEST 2009

Yesterday went well.  The basic infrastructure seems to work.  Now I
need to get the small errors in the representation right.

Currently I have constants tagged to an environment.  This won't hurt,
but doesn't make much sense.  Maybe change the rep a bit.

The environment contains closures (open_term + environment) or
constants.

OK: it's way simpler to make everything a closure, but tag contstants
with an empty environment.

So.. Something is not right.  This gives an error:

   (post (cons 111 ((lambda (abc) 123) 456)))

ERROR: undefined: abc

I currently lost oversight so let's re-connect with the textbook
rules.


Entry: CEK primitives
Date: Thu Aug  6 15:01:19 CEST 2009

Looks like I'm confusing two things:

    * primitive values + fully reduced closures  (lambda + env)

    * non-fully reduced closures (application/varref/value + env)

I'd like to make sure that primitives only see primitive values and
fully reduced closures.  Also, primitives should be able to return
closures (even not fully reduced).

Where is the inconsistency?

Looking at PLLC[1] Chapter 6, p 74 at the CEK reduction rule [cek5], it
seems that primitives get passed _only_ primitive values, not
closures.

How can I make this consistent with a primitive that can operate on
closures as values?

Hmm.. Let's provide better names for the data structure.

1. A continuation frame represents the current state of argument
   evaluation from reducable closures to irreducable closures.

2. A fully evaluated continuation frame can be _applied_ which means
   that a new (reducable) closure is created by extending the closure
   in the first position with variables.


From what I could test it seems that application works fine.  So I
guess I need to figure out how to understand the difference between:

      - a machine where _all_ values are closures, but primitives can
        only accept and return primitive values (which have their
        environment dropped before primitive evaluation)

      - a machine where values are either closures or primitive
        values, and primitive functions can operate on both.

So, either the interpreter's notion of "closure" is made abstract, or
it is changed to directly operate on both primitive values and
closures.

What I could do is the following: regard interpreter state and
environment + data structures as different worlds.

STATE: the current reducable closure and continuation contain closure
structs only, but all communucation with the environment (extension
and reference) and primtives will pack/unpack closures to variables.

Ok. Added closure_pack() and closure_unpack().
